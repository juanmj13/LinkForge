# microservice-playground
Modular collection of Docker‑ready TypeScript microservices and utilities: data‑ingestion apps writing to databases, ESP32‑based MQTT publishers/subscribers, monitoring dashboards, and remote‑control agents. Configurable via .env, runs on Windows/Linux, and easily extended with sensor bridges, OTA updaters, alert hooks, analytics exporters.
